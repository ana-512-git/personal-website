                While I'm currently studying <b>Computer Science</b>, in my free time
                I do all sorts of side quests, like take part in competitions (<b>check out how I prototyped a rocket for an NSS competition in 'Soteria', my first 
                hackathon experience in 'HackItAll 2025' and how i built an actual RC airplane for a student competition in 'WIFI Controlled Airplane'</b>), volunteer at my 
                university's student organization (where I'm currently the <b>IT Team 
                Lead responsible for the web application for a student trivia competition</b>), or sometimes stumble upon new exciting things that have nothing to do with
                my schoolwork (<b>like game development, web development, graphic design and just about whatever else sounds exciting</b>). <br>

                Before you ask, yes, I do have a life that doesn't revolve around my laptop. I genuinley enjoy all kinds of physical activity, and I have for as long as I remember. My current 
                sports-related fixation is going to the gym, since I've recently gotten injured and most other physical activities are off-limits, but I'm planning
                to start training for a marathon next spring. My one true love is coffee, and I will never be caught saying no to a coffee ever in my life.
                I enjoy reading on my commute to school (and before you ask, no, I will not choose one single book
                as my favourite, it's impossible, but I will happily recommend some titles if asked) and trying the most random recipes the internet puts in front 
                of my eyes (they turn out edible 90% of the time).`;
